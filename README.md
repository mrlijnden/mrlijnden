👑 Mr. Lijnden
Part-time aristocrat, full-time code wrangler. Descended from Frans Godert van Lynden van Hemmen, but trading castles for cloud servers. Writing elegant code with the same precision my ancestors wielded their swords... and just as dangerous in a Git merge. 💻🗡️

Fluent in:
🐍 Python – Royal syntax for solving problems.
🦀 Rust – Safety as sturdy as a family crest.
🦅 Swift – Code swift as my noble lineage.
🐹 Golang – Fast, efficient, and stately.

Catch me bug-fixing with royal finesse or adding another branch to the family tree (literally). #nobilityInTech
